# Adding Meshes

## Getting Meshes

Most of the meshes that we used come from [Free3D](https://free3d.com/) and 
[3D Warehouse](https://3dwarehouse.sketchup.com/). If you use meshes from these
websites, please follow their respective licenses, which are generally available for
non-commercial personal use. 

The bicycle mesh that we generated is included in the repo.

Here are some suggested mesh sources:
